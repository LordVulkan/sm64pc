# sm64pc
OpenGL adaptation of [n64decomp/sm64](https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64).

## Features

 * Native rendering. You can now play SM64 without the need of an emulator. 
 * Variable aspect ratio and resolution. The game can now correctly render at basically any window size.
 * Native xinput controller support. On Linux, DualShock 4 has been confirmed to work plug-and-play.
 * True analog camera control is now available on our [testing branch](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64pc/tree/testing).
